# Waku plugin

Create, adapt, publish and edit **mobile playable web content** on the [Waku](https://github.com/POLYVERSE-ENTERTAINMENT-INC) platform — directly from **Claude Code and Codex**. Install once; you get the creation skills, the operations skill, the `waku` CLI, and the Waku multimodal MCP server, all wired up.

## What's inside

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`waku` skill** | Knowledge for creating a new playable from scratch (intake → spec → React/Tailwind build → assets). |
| **`waku-adapt` skill** | Knowledge for adapting an **existing** local game: replace its AI calls with the platform runtime SDK, strip secrets, apply mobile constraints. |
| **`waku-cli` skill** | The publish lifecycle: login, publish to Feed, shareable preview, pull → edit → republish, unpublish, delete, plus the pre-publish conformance check. |
| **`waku` CLI** | The engine for every authenticated action. Not shipped in the plugin — the launcher installs it to `~/.waku` on first use. |
| **`waku` MCP** | Multimodal generation (image / music / sfx / speech / video) used during creation. Auto-registered via `.mcp.json`; reuses your login, mints tokens on demand. |
| **Slash commands** | `/waku:login`, `/waku:create`, `/waku:adapt`, `/waku:publish`, `/waku:edit`. |

## Install

One repo serves both hosts. The `waku` CLI is **not** shipped inside the plugin — a launcher / SessionStart hook installs it to `~/.waku` on first use (idempotent; skipped if already present). You log in once; the session auto-renews and you're never re-prompted while authenticated.

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add POLYVERSE-ENTERTAINMENT-INC/waku-plugin
/plugin install waku@waku
```

Then start a new session. (Local testing: `/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/waku-plugin`.)

### Codex

```
codex plugin marketplace add POLYVERSE-ENTERTAINMENT-INC/waku-plugin
```

Then enable the plugin: run `codex`, open `/plugins`, select **waku → Enable**
(or add to `~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[plugins."waku@waku"]
enabled = true
```

Start a new `codex` session and the `waku` skills + MCP load automatically.

## First run

```
/waku:login          # browser → Waku website OAuth (one time; session auto-renews)
/waku:create         # scaffold a fresh playable and build it
# or
/waku:adapt          # bring an existing local game onto the platform
/waku:publish        # build + publish to your Feed
/waku:edit           # pull a published playable, edit, re-publish
```

## Try the full flow (acceptance)

End-to-end, on either host:

1. **Install** (above), then start a fresh session.
2. `/waku:login` → browser → log in on the Waku website (one time).
3. `/waku:create` → describe a small mobile playable; the agent scaffolds the platform template into a new folder, builds it, and generates any assets via the Waku MCP.
4. `/waku:publish` → builds and publishes to your Waku Feed. You get back a `content_id` + `preview_url`.
5. `/waku:edit` → pull it back, tweak `src/`, republish (same project, new version).
6. `/waku:unpublish` / delete to clean up.

**Expected result:** the playable lands on the platform — the project shows `published`, and `preview_url` serves the game (HTTP 200). On Codex, the same `waku` skills + multimodal MCP tools (`polyverse_*`) are available; publishing goes through the same `waku` CLI and backend.

## How it fits together

- **Skills = knowledge** (bundled, static, updated via `/plugin update`).
- **CLI = actions** (login / publish / pull / republish / unpublish / delete) — one self-updating binary at `~/.waku`, reused by both the commands and the MCP server.
- **MCP = capability** (asset generation during creation) — `waku mcp serve`, zero token in config, reuses your login.
- One `~/.config/waku/auth.json` ties it all together: log in once.

## Maintenance

The creation skills are derived from the Waku monorepo's `managed-skills/`. To refresh them:

```
MONOREPO=/path/to/polyverse_samantha bash scripts/sync-from-monorepo.sh
```

(Then re-apply the plugin-local edits to `skills/waku/SKILL.md` — see the script's note.)
